# CrowFM

## What's this ?

CrowFM is a cross platform file manager.

##How to build
**note : currently only linux os is supported.**

1 - Using cmake to generate Makefiles

2 - Using make to make executable

##Why repo is suspended ?

Extreme weakness documents of cef forced me to suspend the repository.

Another reason is the difficulty of development in other graphical environments.

Now I have started a new project to learn more about GTK. I will continue this repo after a while.
